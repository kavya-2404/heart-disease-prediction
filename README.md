# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on their medical attributes.  
It uses **Machine Learning (Logistic Regression/other models)** to analyze patient health data and classify whether heart disease is present or not.  

The goal is to demonstrate how data-driven models can assist in early detection of heart disease, which is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.
